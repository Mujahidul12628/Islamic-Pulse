                <h2>The Art of Turkish Tea and Coffee</h2>
                <p>
                    Turkish tea and coffee are an essential part of Turkish culture and hospitality. Turkish tea is a black tea, usually served in small glasses with a cube of sugar on the side. It is brewed in a double teapot, with the top pot holding the tea and the bottom pot holding boiling water. Turkish coffee, on the other hand, is a strong and aromatic coffee, served in small cups with a piece of Turkish delight. It is brewed in a cezve, a small copper or brass pot, and is known for its thick and creamy texture.
